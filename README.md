# CANSAT-INSPACe
CANSAT-India 

1) Mission overview :
The CanSat project is a culmination of multiple subsystems working interdisciplinary to achieve the common goal of successfully launching and recovering a can-shaped payload that shall be sent to an apogee of about 800-900 meters.

2) Specifications of CanSat
• Name: CanSat –Team Titans
• Payload Objective: Innovative Descent Control Mechanism Illustration
• Altitude: 800 – 900 m Above Ground Level (AGL)
• Dimensions: 0.125 m (diameter) and 0.310 m (height)
• Estimated Weight: 749.72 g

3) To design a CanSat weighing under 0.700 kg (+/- 0.050 kg), with dimensions not more than 0.125 m diameter and 0.310 m height and capable of withstanding shock loads of launch. The entire CanSat must be an SRAD component that is to be completely developed by the students and must have 2 descent control
4) mechanisms out of which the secondary is an innovative descent control mechanism. A control gyroscope is to be incorporated as part of the payload and must be able to control the attitude of the CanSat during secondary descent. To provide live video feed of all ops on the CanSat simultaneously recording
the same onto local storage on board the CanSat.
